<h2>Basic Info</h2>
 <h3>Location: Springfield, MO</h3>
 <p>Imagine the shape Missouri makes. Springfield is located in the general vicinity of the only 90 degree angle of the state. The less cool little sibling of St. Louis and Kansas City, Springfield is known for Bass Pro Shops and cashew chicken. In that order.</p>
<h3>Why LIS </h3>
<p>I can't imagine working in any other field. I've been working in libraries since 2016, and I keep finding more reasons to love it. Free and unrestricted access to information is something I am very passionate about. There isn't any other job where I feel like I can have a positive impact on the world <strong>and</strong> look forward to work every day.</p>
